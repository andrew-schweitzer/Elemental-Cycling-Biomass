#
# List of Processes
#
#   Erosion:
#       The breakdown of the surface of the crust that deposits minerals and
#       material in the waterways and ocean.
#
#   Subduction:
#       The movement of crust mass and material .
#
#   Convection:
#       The movements of the fluids based upon their temperature. There are three
#       applications of this in the model: the atmosphere, ocean, and mantle. 
#       Although this also exists in the core due to lack of observable data 
#       about the core the behavior is not included in this model.
#
#   Sedimentation:
#       The settling of sediment in the oceans onto the crust where layering
#       pressure, and time for sendiemntary rock in the oceanic crust.
#
#   Accretion:
#
#
#   Precipitation:
#       The movement of minerals from the atmosphere to the ocean and crust
#       via rain and dust settling.
#
#   Volcanism:
#       The movement of mantle material through the crust that can deposit on the
#       crust and occasionally in the ocean. Additionally, non-ocean volcanos
#       move material into the atmosphere.
#
#   Meteors:
#       Solar dust and rocks add minerals and mass to the planet.
